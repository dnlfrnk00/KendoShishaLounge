# ✅ DNS ALREADY CONFIGURED CORRECTLY!

**Good news:** The hosting guy has already set up the DNS records correctly for GitHub Pages. I can see the A records pointing to:
- 185.199.108.153
- 185.199.109.153
- 185.199.110.153
- 185.199.111.153

**No DNS changes needed!** The domain is ready.

## What YOU Need to Do (One-Time Setup)

### 1. Enable Custom Domain in GitHub Pages
Go to: **https://github.com/dnlfrnk00/KendoShishaLounge/settings/pages**

Under **"Custom domain"**:
- Enter: `kendo-lounge.de`
- Click **"Save"**
- Check **"Enforce HTTPS"** (wait a few minutes for the SSL certificate)

That's it! The website will be live at `https://kendo-lounge.de` within 5-10 minutes.

---

## Automatic Updates

Every time you push to GitHub, the website will **automatically rebuild and deploy** within 1-2 minutes.

You can monitor deployments here:
**https://github.com/dnlfrnk00/KendoShishaLounge/actions**

✅ Green checkmark = deployed successfully
❌ Red X = build failed (check logs)

---

## Testing

After enabling the custom domain, wait 5-10 minutes and test:
- https://kendo-lounge.de
- https://www.kendo-lounge.de (should redirect to main domain)

## For the Hosting Guy (No Action Needed)

The DNS records are already perfectly configured. Thank you! 🎉
